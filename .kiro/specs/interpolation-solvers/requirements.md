## Project Description (Input)
Phase 1.3: Numerical Methods - Interpolation and Solvers. Implement 1D/2D interpolation infrastructure and root-finding algorithms for pricer_core. Target: crates/pricer_core/src/math/interpolators/ and solvers/. Key features: (1) Generic Interpolator<T> trait with Linear, CubicSpline, and Monotonic variants, (2) Generic RootFinder<T> trait with Newton-Raphson and Brent methods, (3) smooth_interp function using existing smoothing functions for differentiable interpolation, (4) 2D interpolation support via BilinearInterpolator, (5) Full AD compatibility with Dual64 for sensitivity calculations. Language: British English.
